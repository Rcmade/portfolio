      "For this project, I helped develop a website that allows users to view three-dimensional furniture in homes. My responsibilities included: 3D Model Management: I implemented the ability to upload and display 3D models through Babylon.js, ensuring a simple and enjoyable user experience. Using responsive design I completely redesigned the homepage to work flawlessly on displays including desktop PCs, large screen TVs and used Tailwind CSS to achieve this change. Visualizing files and folders: I worked on the user interface so that users can easily manage their information by displaying all their files and folders. 3D Image Display: I used pannellum-react with images to display images in three dimensions, enhancing the overall viewing experience.",

      "In this project, I played a crucial role in developing a website for an FM radio and media company. My contributions included: User Authentication: Besides providing standard sign-up and sign-in features, I also integrated a few third-party OAuth providers such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter to make things easier for users in accessing the application. Authentication UI: I have designed and developed the signup and signin UI to be user-friendly, eye-catching, and appealing to the users. Live Streaming: I implemented Live Video streaming using HLS for Mac and iOS users, DASH.js for the rest, to make sure that it feels smooth across all devices. Mini Player Integration: Added a mini-player feature, like in YouTube, to continue the live stream below while users navigate the site. Podcast functionality: I have added podcast capabilities, giving the user a chance to listen to their favorite shows directly from your website.",

      "Website for Medical Care Provision-Admin Panel I'm creating the administrator's panel for a website that offers medical treatments as part of this project. As part of a joint venture, I am in charge of creating the client-side user interface, while my partner uses Ruby on Rails for server-side development. Client-Side Development: In order to give consumers a seamless experience, I have completely developed and implemented a client-side user interface (UI) using React. UI Components: I used React Bootstrap to construct responsive and easy-to-use UI components, which helped to keep the administrator's panel consistent. Important functions: I implemented a number of functions, such as personnel administration, inventory management, invoice management, and client appointment scheduling. The project showcases my abilities to design robust yet user-friendly administrative interfaces for the healthcare industry.",

      "This was my personal project, which helped college students by showing them the real-time location of buses. The app was built using React Native for the Android platform, using Express for backend support and MongoDB as the database, and socket.io for websocket. Core features included the capability to track the location of buses and provide current information to the students about the location of the bus, along with the driver and a list of students in the bus. Technology Stack: The project used React Native for the mobile app, and on the back-end, it used Express while MongoDB was used for data storage. Project Status: The application worked; it is no longer up because there were some security issues pointed out by the administration at college. From the above project, it demonstrates my skill in developing a mobile application based on integration of real-time tracking of data hence comprising both the front-end and back-end skills.",

      "This project is my own creation-entirely created for the convenience of printing out in bulk by university students. The web application frontend was created using Next.js, MongoDB as the database, Cloudinary for the uploading of files, Razorpay for payment integrations, and ShadCN UI for the user interface. Core Functionality: The web application gives users the facility to upload their PDF documents, which automatically send hard copies of these documents directly to each classroom to rapidly take care of student printing tasks. Technology Stack: Next.js for seamless web experience; MongoDB for efficient data management; Cloudinary for secure file handling; Razorpay for seamless payment transactions; and ShadCN UI for clean and responsive interface. This project reveals my skills in building full-stack applications that solve real-life problems with regard for user convenience and judicious use of modern technologies.",
